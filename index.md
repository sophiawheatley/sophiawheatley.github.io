# Welcome
My name is Sophia and I work as a research intern at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. My aim is to start a PhD researching age-related diseases. I previously studied psychology at both undergraduate and postgraduate level in Glasgow. Other interests of mine include data science and mental health.
