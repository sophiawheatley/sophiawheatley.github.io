# First Post

It is a rainy day in Berlin during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.
There isn't really a better time to start a blog.
Having worked in a completely new environment (ad tech) for just over a year I am looking forward to going back to research and
learning more about what I love the most, the brain.
The blog posts will predominantly be in the field of psychology and neuroscience, but also some data analysis.
My research interests lie within the field of aging and age-related diseases so I will be writing about these topics.
