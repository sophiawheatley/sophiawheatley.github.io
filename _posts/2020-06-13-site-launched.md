# First Post
It is a rainy day in Berlin during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic - there isn't really a better time to start a blog.
Having worked in a completely new environment (ad tech) for just over a year I am looking forward to going back to doing research and
learning more about what I love the most, the brain. I am looking forward to this new chapter in my life and getting back into it.
The blog posts will predominantly be in the field of psychology and neuroscience, but also some data analysis.
