# Cognitive Reserve
*Work in progress*

## 1. How does "cognitive reserve" fit in with the current neurocognitive ageing models?

* Current aging models
* Cognitive reserve - definition
* How do the two go together?

It is difficult to distinguish the changes in the brain as it changes 'normally'
with age and with the effect of ageing related diseases and these diseases often
coincide with deterioration of certain regions.
Focus on specific regions have been a basis for many ageing and disease prevalence studies.

* what is cognitive reserve?
* does it STAC up?
* brain mechanisms of successful compensation during learning in AD
* prevalence of AD and other dementias... fratiglioni

-- TODOs
plan
1. Add more to STAC section: papers that support/dispute, how it still stacs up
2. Add about HAROLD model
3. How does this all go together -->

## 2. Cognitive reserve
Cognitive reserve is described by Stern in his 2002 paper as one of the two types of reserve (the other being compensation) and is the adoption of networks or paradigms that are 'less susceptible to disruption'.
This process is a way of coping with future atrophies in the brain and explains the observation that people with higher levels of education and intelligence did not show the cognitive effects of the same amount of brain damage as others with lower education.
Cognitive reserve can differ across individuals and is affected by multiple factors which can be biologically determined, but also from external surroundings (Mayo Clinic whitepaper 2020).


Brain reserve on the other hand assumes that once a patient reaches a certain threshold that they will most likely develop symptoms.
Whereas the cognitive reserve model argues that brain damage does not directly relate to cognitive disruptions and that the brain adapts to using alternate strategies to solve the problem at hand.
Essentially the more reserve one has, the better the brain is at using these other approaches and thus making it a stronger force against the biological restrictions.

### 2.1 Compensation models
The other form of reserve is compensation which is the adoption of other brain regions that are not used when the brain is not damaged.
What is meant by this is when comparing the brain regions used for cognitive tasks by controls and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients different networks were activated.

However there is still some debate about whether AD patients present these compensation effects.
When comparing AD patients with healthy controls on encoding and retrieving visuospatial objects, brain activity between did not differ significantly when controls performed a harder version and AD patients easier version.
However Ad patients did display increased activity of left medial and right lateral prefrontal cortices when encoding of two object locations, whereas this was not present in the controls when they encoded three object locations (Gould et al 2006).


### 2.2 STAC (Parker-Reuter & Lorenz)
"The Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition" or also known as STAC was first proposed in 2009 is a cognitive ageing model that explains the differences in cognitive abilities that can be explained by adverse effects and compensation that are a result of ageing.

### 2.3 HAROLD (Cabeza)
More bilateral use of the PFC in older participants compared to younger participants
